Challenge submission for Module 20 - Supervised Learning


This analysis aims to characterize the performance of the machine learning model used in this code by taking into account the precision, accuracy, and recall of the two labels. These parameters will be used to determine whether the model is appropriate in the setting of lending finance.

- Healthy loans (0) are predicted with 99.64% precision, 89.61% accuracy, and 99.57% recall.

- High-Risk loans (1) are predicted with 87.46% precision, 99.24% accuracy, and 89.28% recall.


- Overall, the model is 94.43% accurate.


- In the finance of lending, risks are taken on both sides of a transaction. 

- It is in the lending company's best interest to minimize this risk in favor of profits.

- With these factors in mind, it seems reasonable that a model which performs accurately about 95% of the time should be trusted in such a setting.
